    // I chose Objective-C as the main project language file for this project (WOAHS-X Calculator) as I intend to write this software piece in Objective-C to match the subsystem that is based on the system that this is based on. I could have chosen AppleScript, but I decided to leave that for another version. Objective-C is getting its own project language file, starting here.
